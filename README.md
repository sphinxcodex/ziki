The New Ziki

<p>A blogging network like medium - but it runs on your own self-hosted domain. </br>
It does not run on a url like medium.com/markessien, but I install it on markessien.com. </br>
When I am there and logged in, I can write blog posts and publish them. </br>
Others using the same software can <b>follow</b> my own blog using RSS. </br>
You see what others are writing on your own timeline. </br>
I can comment on my own timeline, and it shows up on your own website. </br>
I can select various themes for the blog, though they all follow the same general look and feel.</p>


This app is created <b>without a database</b>
The posts are stored as markdown files.
