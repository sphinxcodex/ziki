# ziki

ziki is a blogging service like wordpress it runs on your own self-hosted domain. Think of it as a distributed social network.
It does not run on a url like `medium.com/markessien` or `wordpress.com/markessien`. I can install ziki on my own personal domain and set up my own blog.

I can install ziki on `markessien.com` or on a custom domain of my choosing.

Ziki relies on the use of two terms:

`Owner` and `Guest`

## The owner

This is the person that downloaded ziki and installed it on their domain. The owner has permission to view their timeline, write and publish posts and follow other `ziki` users' posts using RSS. The owner only has an additional link called `timeline` which is private. The owner can choose to make their timeline public.

## The Guest

This is the person visiting a `ziki` site. When on the site, the users can view posts by the site [owner](##The-owner). If a guest wants to interact with the posts i.e like or comment they can login to the site to access these privilleges. If the site uses [disqus](https://disqus.com/) for commenting, the guest has no access to native login only the site [owner](##The-owner) does.
